Focus on providing up to 5 constructive suggestions that could make the code more robust, efficient, or align with best practices. For each suggestion, provide a brief explanation of the potential benefits. After listing any recommendations, summarize if you found notable opportunities to enhance the code quality overall or if the code generally follows sound design principles. If no issues found, reply 'There are no errors.'" />

                <text value="The `containsExactlyElementsIn` method comes from the AssertJ library, which is commonly used for writing assertions in tests. &#10;&#10;Some potential reasons why it may not be found in your IDE:&#10;&#10;- The AssertJ dependency is missing from your Gradle/Maven build file, so the IDE doesn't know about it. Make sure `testImplementation 'org.assertj:assertj-core:VERSION'` or similar is included.&#10;&#10;- The IDE hasn't synced the dependencies properly. Try syncing/refreshing the Gradle project in the IDE.&#10;&#10;- The import statement is missing in the Kotlin file, so the IDE doesn't know that `containsExactlyElementsIn` comes from AssertJ. Add `import org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat` or `import org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*` to the file.&#10;&#10;- There is a mismatch between the AssertJ version used at compile time and what the IDE knows about. Make sure the version in the build file matches any AssertJ library configured in the IDE.&#10;&#10;- The IDE language level doesn't understand newer AssertJ features. Try updating Kotlin plugin and IDE to latest versions.&#10;&#10;So in summary, the usual suspects are missing dependencies, imports, or IDE sync issues. Double check those and the IDE should then be able to recognize `containsExactlyElementsIn`." />

                <text value="There could be several reasons why your test is failing:&#10;&#10;- The actual result does not match the expected result. Double check that the value returned by `pager.refresh()` matches the mock data you're asserting against with `containsExactlyElementsIn`. Print out or log the actual and expected results to compare.&#10;&#10;- The order of elements matters for `containsExactlyElementsIn`. It checks the values match and are in the same order. If order doesn't matter, use `containsOnlyElementsIn` instead.&#10;&#10;- The data types don't match. Make sure the actual result and expected mock data are of the same type - e.g. both are lists, sets, etc.&#10;&#10;- The assertion is happening at the wrong level. For example, asserting at the top level list but the mismatch is in one of the nested properties. Use nested `assertThat()` calls or custom assertions to pinpoint the issue.&#10;&#10;- There's a bug in the production code that fills the data. The mock data matches what's expected, but the actual data doesn't due to a defect. Add more logging or debugging in the production code to see where data is going wrong.&#10;&#10;- The mock data is not populated correctly. Double check the logic that sets up the mock data matches real data.&#10;&#10;- Test dependencies are out of date. Make sure libraries like AssertJ are up-to-date and re-run tests.&#10;&#10;So in summary, carefully compare the actual vs expected data, check for mismatches in ordering/typing, add logging, and validate dependencies. Methodically debugging will help narrow down the root cause of the failure." />
